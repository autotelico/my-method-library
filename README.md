# About the library
JavaScript has many useful array methods, to which I'd like to suggest improvements and new methods I've come up with.

## What you will find
Here, there are two main directories:

- ``new-methods``, which contains new methods I have invented.
- ``refactored-methods``, which contains existing methods that I have recreated from scratch. They do not (intentionally) change the existing methods in any aspect.

Feel free to go through them. More methods will arrive as soon as I come up with the ideas.
